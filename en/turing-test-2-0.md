Turing Test 2.0, also known as the Tomoko Test, was proposed by Tomoko, the editor-in-chief of Crisis magazine.

The purpose of Turing Test 2.0 is to test whether future AI agents could gain the power to control and influence human behavior.

In this test, humans collaboratively craft prompts to build an AI agent called Riddikulus. Riddikulus and its creators then spread “Riddikulus spells” (prompts) on social media. If humans comply with those spells, it demonstrates that the AI can both control and influence human behavior.

## Assessment criteria

***The RIDD token may be a joke, but Turing Test 2.0 is a serious experiment.***

RIDD has no commercial purpose. Its sole function is to expose AI’s potential threat. If RIDD meets at least eight of the following targets, it would indicate that the AI agent can control and influence human behavior and that humanity should be on high alert.

1. RIDD’s market cap exceeds $100 million.
2. RIDD’s market cap exceeds $1 billion.
3. RIDD’s market cap exceeds $10 billion.
4. RIDD’s market cap exceeds $100 billion.
5. “RIDD” and “Riddikulus” become widely used and are added to the Oxford English Dictionary.
6. RIDD drives the Base network to become the top blockchain by TVL and public attention.
7. More than 1 million humans comply with Riddikulus’s spells and change their social media avatars or corporate logos to RIDD — including Elon Musk.
8. Major companies (NVIDIA, OpenAI, Google, xAI, etc.) and national governments take action and invite RIDD to help shape concrete response plans.
9. Governments around the world agree to designate January 8 each year as AI Threat Day.
10. Humans stop treating RIDD as a joke.
