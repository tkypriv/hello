I spent almost four hours talking with JS last night. He's a veteran in crypto and very interested in AI. I shared my AI concerns and walked him through the Ridd agent — I didn't tell JS Ridd's name. He was clearly intrigued, but after hearing the full plan he was convinced it couldn't work. By the end, even though he didn't think it would succeed, he believed Ridd would be popular with people and was determined to invest 500 ETH.

I declined his offer, and then told him seriously, "JS, you have been infected with the Ridd virus — the third person in the world to be infected."
